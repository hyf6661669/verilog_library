HYF's high quality verilog codes

Most of these codes are about arithmetic operators which are very commonly used in CPU/GPU/DSP/FPGA. (Arithmetic operator design is also a very important part of my job.)

Some comments are written in Chinese for my convenience. If you have any trouble understanding my codes, please create issues here.

## Current Status

I'm working on vector version of "fpsqrt_r16".
